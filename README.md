### Features

#### 1. Saves Precious Time

Does your team spend too much time screening candidates? Let it get back to doing what they do best - building the product - and let automation do the tedious work for you.

#### 2. Fast and relevant

Our platform lets you filter developers by basic technical skills that developers use everyday. This is way faster than a phone pre-screen, more relevant than a resume stuffed full of buzzwords.

#### 3. Applicant approved

Technical candidates love our platform. Apply-by-AI is not just fast, it is way more fun than sending plain emails. We understand the tedious part of uploading a resume and managing one and help you offload it to your platform.
